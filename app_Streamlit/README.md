# Introduction
streamlit is a relatively new tool, through which we can quickly deploy our models to the cloud platform as static web pages without any knowledge of web development.\\

1. Before using it, we need to install the relevant packages in the environment, as follows:

Streamlit provides many functions for layout, such as `st.sidebar`, `st.columns`, `st.title`, etc. .\\
3. After deploying the model as needed, run in the terminal:

and view the results locally.\\
